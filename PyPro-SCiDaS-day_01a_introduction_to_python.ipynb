    "My primary concern is to spark interest in a subject as challenging as computer programming. My approach isn't heavily focused on pure algorithmics, but this is becoming less and less of a requirement for learning modern object-oriented programming. I also hope to open as many doors as possible with these notes. Indeed, it seems important to me to show that computer programming is a vast universe of concepts and methods, in which everyone can find their area of interest. I want each student to develop skills somewhat different from those of others, tailored to their inclinations, allowing them to value themselves in their own eyes as well as in those of their peers, and also to make a specific contribution when asked to collaborate on large-scale projects. Moreover, emphasis is placed on manipulating different types of data structures, as these are the backbone of any software development. The ultimate goal for each student will be to complete an original programming project of significant importance. There are a large number of programming languages, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. One must be chosen. For my own beginnings in studying programming, I used Python, which is a very modern language with growing popularity.\n",

    "### 0.0. Why Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python programming language is an excellent option for both beginners and those with more advanced knowledge. It is a high-level language with a syntax that encourages writing clear and high-quality code. Additionally, learning Python is facilitated by the existence of an interactive interface, particularly through the use of `Jupyter notebooks`. That said, its appeal goes beyond just learning programming or algorithms; its popularity and usage extend well beyond the academic realm, as evidenced by its growing popularity. It has been chosen by major players such as `Google`, `YouTube`, and `NASA`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a general-purpose programming language (i.e., serving multiple purposes and applicable to various fields of computer science). It is an interpreted language (meaning each line of code is read and then interpreted to be executed) rather than a compiled language. One of Python's greatest strengths is its portability, meaning its ability to run on different platforms (Mac OS X, Unix, Windows, etc.). It operates with an object-oriented approach and provides a complete development environment that includes, in addition to an interpreter, a set of libraries. It has numerous modules that offer flexibility in their usage: writing web applications (Django), scientific calculations, data processing, text processing, data analysis, network management (socket library), access to relational databases, etc. This great flexibility and its ability to integrate into different technical environments make it a top choice for Big Data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The main features of the Python language:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Simple** and __readable__ syntax: educational language that is easy to learn and use;\n",
    "- __Interpreted language__: interactive use or line-by-line script execution, no compilation process;\n",
    "- __High-level__: dynamic typing, active memory management, for greater ease of use;\n",
    "- __Multi-paradigm__: imperative and/or object-oriented language, depending on individual needs and capabilities;\n",
    "- __Free__ and __open-source__ software, widely spread (multi-platform) and used (strong community);\n",
    "- __Rich standard library__: Batteries included;\n",
    "- __Rich external library__: many high-quality libraries available in various fields (including scientific).\n",
    "\n",
    "Different versions of Python (for *Windows*, *Unix*, etc.), its original **tutorial**, its __reference manual__, the **documentation** for function libraries, etc., are available for free download from the [official website](http://www.python.org).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this course is to learn a *single* high-level language, which allows for both quick analyses in everyday life – with just a few lines of interactive code – as well as more complex programs (larger projects, e.g., more than 100,000 lines).\n",

    "### 0.1. Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook introduces the free Python language and describes the initial commands necessary to get started with the language. The content is accessible to both beginners and relatively experienced users. It is well-suited for someone who wants to learn Python programming, but it also contains the essentials for getting acquainted with data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more in-depth study, there are numerous educational resources available online. For example, the [official tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html) for Python 3.4 provides abundant information for beginners. There is also [Sheppard's (2014)](http://www.kevinsheppard.com/images/0/09/Python_introduction.pdf) book, which offers an introduction to Python for Econometrics, Statistics, and Data Analysis, and [Mac Kinney's (2013)](http://it-ebooks.info/book/1041/) book, the principal author of the `pandas` library that we will discuss in a later notebook.\n",

    "### 0.3. Python 2.7 vs. 3 (or more specifically, Python 2.7 vs 3.5)\n",
    "\n",
    "I will briefly discuss the differences between Python 2.x and Python 3.x. Although this is not a major issue for this course, I think it's worth mentioning. Python comes in several versions that may be suitable for econometrics, statistics, and numerical analysis. Python 2.7 is the final version of the Python 2.x series — all future development work will focus on Python 3. Most differences between Python 2.7 and 3 are not critical for using Python in econometrics, statistics, and numerical analysis, i.e., scientific computing in general.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, I mention four notable differences that will allow you to use 2.7 and 3 interchangeably. Note that these differences are relatively significant in standalone Python programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`print`**\n",
    "\n",
    "`print()` is a function used to display text in the console when running programs. In Python 2.7, `print` is a keyword that behaves differently from other functions. In Python 3, `print` behaves like most other functions. The standard usage in Python 2.7 is\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "   print \"Strings to display.\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "whereas in Python 3, the standard usage is\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "   print(\"Strings to display.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "which resembles the call of a standard function. Python 2.7 includes a version of the Python 3 print function, which can be used in any program by including:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "   from __future__ import print_function\n",
    "```\n",
    "at the top of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. <left> <b> <span style=\"color:brown;\">division</span> </b></left>\n",
    "\n",
    "Python 3 changes the way integers are divided. In Python 2.7, the division of two integers always resulted in an integer, and so the results were truncated toward 0 if the result was fractional. For example, in Python 2.7, 9/5 is 1. Python 3 gracefully converts the result to a floating-point number, so in Python 3, 9/5 is 1.8. When working with numerical data, automatic conversion of divisions helps avoid some rare errors. Python 2.7 can use Python 3's behavior by including:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "   from __future__ import division\n",
    "```\n",
    "at the top of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. <left> <b> <span style=\"color:brown;\">range</span> </b></left> and <left> <b> <span style=\"color:brown;\">xrange</span> </b></left>\n",
    "\n",
    "It is often useful to generate a sequence of numbers for iteration over some data. In Python 2.7, the best practice is to use the keyword `xrange` for this purpose, while in Python 3, this keyword has been renamed to `range`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. <left> <b> <span style=\"color:brown;\">Unicode Strings</span> </b></left>\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python 3, text strings are Unicode by default. In Python 2, strings are stored in ASCII by default—you need to add a \"u\" if you want to store Unicode strings in Python 2.x. This is important because Unicode is more versatile than ASCII. Unicode strings can store foreign language letters, Roman numerals, symbols, emojis, etc., giving you more options. In practice, this is unlikely to affect numeric code written in Python except possibly when reading or writing data. If you work in a language context where characters outside the standard 128-character ASCII set are used but are limited to those commonly encountered, it may be useful to use:\n",
    "\n",
