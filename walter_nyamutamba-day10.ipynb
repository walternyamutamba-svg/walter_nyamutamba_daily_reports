    "Once your code becomes more complex, you‚Äôll often face the question: *Will it run?*  \n",
    "Unfortunately, the answer is often *no* ‚Äî but that‚Äôs where **debugging** comes in.  \n",
    "Debugging is the process of **finding and fixing errors (bugs)** in your code.  \n",
    "While debugging can seem daunting, the following principles can make it easier and more effective.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Debugging Techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "Some common techniques to debug Python code include:\n",
    "\n",
    " -  Print Statements: Using `print()` to display the values of variables at different points in the code.\n",
    " - Using a Debugger: Tools like the `Python Debugger (PDB)` allow you to step through the code, inspect variables, and understand the flow of execution.\n",
    " - Reading `Error Messages`: Python provides detailed error messages that can help pinpoint the location and cause of an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use Exceptions Precisely\n",
    "\n",
    "Handle critical parts of your code with well-defined **`try`‚Äì`except`** blocks to manage possible errors. This helps identify where issues arise and makes your program more resilient.\n",
    "\n",
    "> üóíÔ∏è **Tip:** Write clear error messages inside your `except` blocks and document them (e.g., in Markdown).  \n",
    "> Consider keeping a developer log or *wiki* that lists possible error sources and how to fix them.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use Descriptive Variable Names\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose **clear, meaningful names** for variables, functions, and classes.  \n",
    "Avoid ambiguous abbreviations ‚Äî only use acronyms if they‚Äôre widely understood.  \n",
    "For readability:\n",
    "- Use **lowercase letters** for variables and functions.  \n",
    "- Use **CamelCase** for class names.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deal with Errors\n",
    "\n",
    "When an error occurs, **read the error message carefully** ‚Äî often more than once.  \n",
    "This helps you **understand the origin** of the problem.  \n",
    "Error messages usually specify:\n",
    "- The script or file where the issue occurred.  \n",
    "- The exact line number.  \n",
    "- The error type (e.g., `TypeError`, `NameError`, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "If the issue isn‚Äôt clear (for example, from an external library), use a search engine or documentation to troubleshoot effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Verify Output\n",
    "\n",
    "Just because code runs successfully doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean that the **result (output)** is correct.  \n",
    "Always validate your output using known input‚Äìoutput pairs ‚Äî for example, compare your program‚Äôs results to a manual calculation or a verified source.  \n",
    "Make sure the output produced by your code **matches the expected (desired) output**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Code with a Structured Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "Before jumping into writing code, take time to **plan its structure**.  \n",
    "Avoid immediately creating random blocks of code; instead, use structural and behavioral diagrams to organize your logic.  \n",
    "Concepts like [**UML diagrams**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language#Diagrams) (Unified Modeling Language) are helpful tools in software engineering for designing and visualizing your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ‚úèÔ∏è **Tip:** Take a sheet of paper and a pencil before you start coding. Sketch how your code should work and produce the desired output.\n",

    "## Soft Alternatives\n",
    "\n",
    "When you‚Äôre stuck, try explaining your problem aloud ‚Äî even to yourself.  \n",
    "Rephrasing or describing a problem to another person (real or imaginary) can often help you **clarify your own thinking**.\n",
    "\n",
    "If frustration builds, **step away from the code**.  \n",
    "Take a walk, sleep on the problem, or do something that requires minimal concentration.  \n",
